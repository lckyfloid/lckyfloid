        // Typewriter Effect with Sound
        const text = ` I’ve been thinking about how to say this for weeks, and honestly it still feels strange to even put it into words. Every time I try to practice it in my head, it comes out messy, so I figured doing it this way might be the only way I can say everything clearly. I noticed that you talk to me whenever you get the chance, even in small moments that other people would ignore. Like that time in the cc when we were doing laps and you slowed down, and when I finally caught up you asked how many laps I had done. You didn’t have to stay beside me, but you did, and we ran like that for a while even though I got shy and ended up running ahead. Or the time you told me good luck before my one-on-one debate and congratulated me after. It was such a simple thing, but it felt sincere enough that it stayed in my mind longer than I expected. It lingered within me.

And then there are all the tiny moments that I keep thinking about. When you asked if I ever drink coffee. And you just suddenly shared that you didn’t have a good sleep that day because you drank coffee. I didn’t know what to do with that information. Was I supposed to say rest well? Or how many cups did it take to make your head hurt? I really don’t know. When you showed me that Mang Inasal in the middle of Mayon Volcano and you looked so amused by your own joke. It was actually funny, I do admit it. And that random moment when you told me something about your childhood that I didn’t even ask for, but I found it cute because you trusted me enough to say it. I can remember a lot more, but I would sound like a creep to even mention all of those. I keep remembering how you initiate conversations even when you look a bit hesitant at first, like you want to talk to me but you are still testing if the moment is right. I notice that, even if I pretend not to. But I always wonder, what are those for? What’s the agenda behind it?

I know sometimes I seem quiet or uninterested when you talk to me. I know I probably look like I am brushing things off or keeping my distance, and I want you to know that it is not because I do not want to talk to you. I actually do. I just… do not really know how to handle kindness when it is directed at me like that. I have not felt this sort of attention before, so I keep convincing myself that you are just being friendly and I should not assume anything. I promised myself to be grounded. I tell myself not to read too deeply into it, but somehow I still end up replaying things in my head. I did not want to catch feelings for someone who was only showing me decency. I did not want to fool myself into thinking it meant anything. But I guess I already did. And it is starting to feel too heavy to keep everything inside.

So this is me, trying to be honest in the only way I know how. I am not asking for anything in return. I am not expecting anything either. I just needed to say it because it is tiring to pretend I do not feel anything when I do. I know this might sound cowardly, but this is the best I can do right now. I could not bring myself to say this out loud, so I put it here instead. If any of this means something to you, then maybe you will remember the moments I mentioned, the same way I remember them. And if it doesn’t, then that’s alright too. Just let this be one of those things that fades quietly, and I’ll accept that.

This comes from someone anonymous, and I may never get the chance to say it to you in person. Maybe this will be our last encounter, or maybe we’ll keep passing by each other like nothing happened, but I needed to put these thoughts somewhere before they stayed inside me forever. I hope that you continue to be the person who notices the little things, who spreads kindness and encouragement without even realizing how much it matters. I hope you keep inspiring the people around you the way you’ve inspired me, even in ways you might never see. And I hope that whatever path you take, you never lose the warmth and sincerity that makes you… you. If this reaches you, I want you to know that your actions, no matter how small they seem, have left a mark—and I will always carry that quietly with me. 

Till we meet again. :)
